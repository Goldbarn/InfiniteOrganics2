# WELCOME TO INFINITE ORGANICS

### The Vision

This project was inspired by the likes of Infinite Craft and Pokemon, and the limitations inherent in each. \
\
Pokemon, the limited number of monsters to catch. What fun is it if you can *actually* catch them all? And why can they only learn certain types of skills? We endevour to fix these faults.\
Infinite Craft, the lackluster nature of the game. You can combine things, big whoop, what if you want to *do something* with the creations you make? What if you want to actually invent functional things in a sandbox merging game? THe lack of distinction between items limits uniqueness as well.\
\
To solve these problems comes the new project, **INFINITE ORGANICS**, with an unlimited number of types, moves, and monsters to mix and match as you will!

### The Project

To this end we create a system with which to combine elemental types, unique monsters, and individual moves to create, respectively, completely new ones. The new ones can be combined, the moves applied to monsters to create teams, and so on and so forth.\
\
Each type has other types it is advantageous against, and ones it is weak against in battle. Battle itself is in progress.

### About

To use the program, you will need to get a [Google Gemini api key](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs#python) and put it in the file called Put-Google-Gemini-API-Key-Here.txt\
\
You will also need Google-genai, Flask, Flask-CORS, and Python3 to run the app.\
\
To actually run it, you need to navigate into the folder, and run the file ai.py as a python3 file, then navigate to whatever localhost port it runs on, typically 5000.
